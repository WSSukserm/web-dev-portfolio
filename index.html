          <h2> Who, me? </h2>
          <div class="half-width">
            <p>Something enticed me into the tech field. Unfortunately, it wasn’t the same kind of cookies. <em>But</em>, I did make my venture inside this magically infinite world after earning my degree in Journalism. </p>
            <p>It began as a knack for writing. Then, one WordPress blog, 99 Instagram posts, and a Tumblr full of aesthetically beautiful images later, I realized that much of my spare time is spent creating and composing. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="half-width">
            <p>The next step was only a natural inclination to create a fully functioning, responsive website where I could share this collective hobby. In that, madness ensued (not really - sane madness of sorts). </p>
            <p> Front-end web development opened up a once limited world of click-to-post to a surprising interest in coding where I can apply both my creativity and meticulousness in a field I couldn’t be more curious about.</p>

            <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
            <p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot, and accessible.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="fourth-width">
            <img src="img/css-icon.png" alt="CSS icon" />
            <h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
            <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>

            <h3>Converting Designs into Code</h3>
            <p>You can trust me to take a designer's PSD and quickly & accurately convert it into a webpage that is pixel-perfect match.</p>

            <h3>That's it?</h3>
            <p>Nope! There's always more learning to do and more skills to build. Currently, I'm learning about responsive web development. After that, I'll be on to JavaScript!
